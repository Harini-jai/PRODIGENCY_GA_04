# PRODIGENCY_GA_04
# Stable Diffusion Image Generation using PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to generate images from text prompts using Stable Diffusion v1.5 with the Diffusers library and PyTorch.

Project Overview

Stable Diffusion is a powerful text-to-image generative model.
In this project, we generate an AI-created image from a simple text prompt using a pre-trained model.

Prompt example:

"A student doing internship work on artificial intelligence"

The model processes the prompt and generates a realistic image based on it.

 # Technologies Used

Python

PyTorch
